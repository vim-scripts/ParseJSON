This plugin does not do anything by itself. This is a recursive-descent
JSON parser intended to be called from other Vim plugins or scripts.
Although it is possible to parse JSON in Vim using eval(), that is
dangerous if the JSON is from an untrusted source.

Note: true, false, and null are parsed to 1, 0, and {} respectively because
there are no equivalents to those values in Vim script.

Usage:
    let result = ParseJSON(json_str)

Example:
    :echo ParseJSON('{ "hello" : { "a list" : [ 1, 2, "world", true ] }}')
    {'hello': {'a list': [1, 2, 'world', 1]}}
